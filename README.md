Meri Raay is a web application developed in lieu of attaining political transparency in a democratic country, like India. It is a online democratic voting system for the citizens to prioritise the problems to be solved in their city.

Meri Raay is a clause for “My Opinion towards making a difference in the decisions being taken by the government”. Keeping the legacy of the word,
"democracy" in mind, Meri Raay is an online voting system which helps maintain political transparency and accelerate the process of taking decisions 
through public voting.

The problems being faced by the city as noticed by the District Commissioner will be posted on the web platform through which the citizens for that
area can prioritise and help the problem solve faster.
